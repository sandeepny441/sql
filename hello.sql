Sure, I can help with that. Let's create 10 variations for each of the four questions.

### 1. Get the transactionID of the scans done in the last 2 days.

1. Can you retrieve the transaction IDs for scans performed within the past 48 hours?
2. Fetch the transaction IDs of all scans completed in the last two days.
3. Provide the transaction IDs for the scans conducted over the past two days.
4. What are the transaction IDs for the scans carried out in the last 48 hours?
5. List the transaction IDs of scans done within the previous 2 days.
6. Can you show me the transaction IDs for scans from the last 2 days?
7. Retrieve the transaction IDs for all scans done in the past 2 days.
8. Can I get the transaction IDs for scans performed over the last 48 hours?
9. What transaction IDs were generated for scans in the last two days?
10. Give me the transaction IDs for all scans completed in the last two days.

### 2. Get all the authorization documents involved in a transaction.

1. Fetch all authorization documents related to a specific transaction.
2. Provide all the authorization documents for a given transaction.
3. Can you retrieve all authorization documents associated with a transaction?

6. Can you show me all the authorization documents for a certain transaction?
7. Retrieve all authorization documents linked to a specific transaction.
8. Get all the authorization documents pertaining to a given transaction.
9. Can I get all authorization documents for a particular transaction?
10. Provide me with all authorization documents involved in a specific transaction.

### 3. For a given transactionID, get us all the relevant information.

1. Retrieve all relevant information for a specified transaction ID.
2. Provide all the details for the given transaction ID.
3. Can you fetch all relevant information for a particular transaction ID?
