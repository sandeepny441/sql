# EDA

# Ad Performance Metrics
# What is the distribution of click-through rates (CTR) across different ad placements?
# How do conversion rates vary by ad location (e.g., social media, search engines, email)?
# Which ad placements have the highest engagement scores?
# Cluster Characteristics
# What are the defining characteristics of each cluster identified by the KMeans algorithm?
# Are there distinct groups of ads that perform similarly in terms of CTR, conversion rates, and engagement?
# Ad Location Analysis
# How does ad location correlate with performance metrics like CTR and conversion rates?
# Which ad locations are most commonly associated with high-performing ads?
# Relationship Between Metrics
# Is there a correlation between CTR and conversion rates?
# Does a higher engagement score correlate with a better conversion rate?
# Impact of Content and Design
# Are certain content types or ad designs more effective in certain locations or clusters?
# How does the ad content type (text, image, video) relate to its performance metrics?
# User Interaction
# What patterns can be observed in the way users interact with different ad placements?
# Are there specific user actions that are predictive of higher ad performance?
# Temporal Patterns
# Do ad performance metrics vary by time of day, day of the week, or season?
# How do performance metrics of ads change over time, and are there any trends?
# Conversion and Churn
# Which ad placements are most effective at driving conversions without leading to churn?
# Are there common features among ads that lead to conversions but also have high bounce rates?
# Traffic Sources
# How does the traffic source influence the performance of ads?
# Are ads on certain platforms more effective at driving traffic than others?
# Decision Tree Insights
# What rules does the decision tree model use to classify ad performance?
# Can decision trees reveal any non-linear relationships between ad features and their performance?
