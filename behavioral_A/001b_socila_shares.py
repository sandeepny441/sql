# Since we do not have the actual dataset and share count data, we will use the previously created dummy dataset
# and add a 'SharesCount' feature to it. Then, we'll follow the outlined steps for implementation.

# Load the dataset from the file
df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/best_buy_dummy_dataset.csv')

# Adding a dummy 'SharesCount' feature for the sake of example (using a random distribution)
np.random.seed(0)  # For reproducibility
df['SharesCount'] = np.random.poisson(lam=30, size=df.shape[0])  # Average share count of 30

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# For the sake of brevity, we'll only show a few EDA steps here.

# Check the distribution of SharesCount
shares_count_distribution = df['SharesCount'].describe()

# Check correlation of SharesCount with numerical features
correlation_with_shares = df[numeric_features + ['SharesCount']].corr()['SharesCount'].sort_values()

# EDA Questions:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# General Distribution
# What is the distribution of shares count across all products?
# Are there certain products that have significantly higher shares count than others?
# Relationship with Numerical Features
# How does the price of a product relate to its shares count?
# Is there a correlation between the number of historical likes or dislikes and the shares count?
# Do products with higher discounts tend to have more shares?
# What is the relationship between review scores and shares count?
# Does the number of reviews a product receives correlate with how often it is shared?
# Relationship with Categorical Features
# Which product categories are shared most frequently?
# Are certain campaign types more successful at generating shares?
# Do user segments differ in their sharing behavior?
# Time-Based Analysis
# Is there any seasonal pattern to when products are shared?
# How do sales in the last month affect the current month's shares count?
# Outliers and Anomalies
# Are there any outliers in the shares count data that could skew the results?
# What are the characteristics of products that have unusually high or low shares count?
# Cross-Feature Interactions
# Is there an interaction effect between product price and discount on the shares count?
# How do various combinations of product categories and campaign types affect the number of shares?
# Comparative Analysis
# How does the shares count compare across different stock availability statuses (in stock, out of stock, limited stock)?
# Is there a difference in the shares count between newly released products and those that have been on the market longer?
# Advanced EDA
# Can clustering algorithms identify distinct groups of products based on sharing patterns?
# Are there any latent factors that could be extracted from the data that correlates with shares count?
# Predictive Insights
# What features are most predictive of a high shares count based on a preliminary feature importance analysis?
# Could the shares count be predicted effectively by linear patterns, or is there evidence of more complex, non-linear relationships?
# Textual Data Insights (if applicable)
# If product descriptions or campaign content text data are available, what keywords or topics are associated with higher shares?
# User Behavior Analysis
# Do return customers share products more frequently than new customers?
# Is there a relationship between user engagement metrics (like website visits, time spent on page) and shares count?

# Feature Engineering
# For the purposes of this example, we'll assume the existing features are sufficient.

# Model Building
# We will construct a RandomForestRegressor to predict the SharesCount based on other features.

# Split the data into features and target
X = df.drop(columns=['SharesCount', 'ProductID', 'ProductName', 'ReleaseYear'])  # Drop non-predictive and target features
y = df['SharesCount']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the preprocessing pipeline
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numeric_transformer, numeric_features),
        ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_features)
    ])

# Define the model pipeline
model_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('regressor', RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42))
])

# Train the model
model_pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model using cross-validation
cv_scores = cross_val_score(model_pipeline, X_train, y_train, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')

# Output the cross-validation results
mean_cv_score = -cv_scores.mean()

# Evaluate the model on the test set
y_pred = model_pipeline.predict(X_test)
test_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
test_r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

(shares_count_distribution, correlation_with_shares, mean_cv_score, test_mse, test_r2)
