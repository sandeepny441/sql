
# 1. Prepare the Data:
# Load the dataset containing user comments.
# Preprocess the text data (tokenization, lowercasing, removing stopwords, etc.).
# 2. Sentiment Analysis:
# Use a pre-trained sentiment analysis model or train a Naive Bayes classifier on labeled sentiment data.
# Predict sentiment scores for each user comment.
# 3. Aggregate and Interpret Results:
# Aggregate sentiment scores to calculate an overall sentiment score for the products or services.
# Analyze the scores to identify areas for improvement or to highlight strengths.

# Hypothetical user comments dataset
comments = [
    "Love the quick service and friendly staff!",
    "Had a great experience purchasing my new laptop. Highly recommend!",
    "The product quality has gone down over the years. Very disappointed.",
    "Customer support was helpful and resolved my issue quickly.",

import pandas as pd

# Sentiment analysis with TextBlob (as an example, since Naive Bayes requires training data)
def analyze_sentiment(comment):
    testimonial = TextBlob(comment)
    return testimonial.sentiment.polarity  # Polarity score ranges from -1 to 1

# Calculate sentiment scores for each comment
sentiment_scores = [analyze_sentiment(comment) for comment in comments]

# Create a DataFrame
sentiment_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Comment': comments,
    'SentimentScore': sentiment_scores
