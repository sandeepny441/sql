# What is the most expensive product, as an equivalent to asking for the top 1% in terms of price?

# What are the top two most expensive products in each category, simulating a top 4% query if the dataset were larger?


# Among the products listed, which belong to the most expensive 50%?

# With the dataset provided, these questions would effectively translate to simply finding the highest prices or the median price point. In a larger dataset, you could use SQL window functions like NTILE() to divide the dataset into percentiles and then select the top Nth percentile accordingly.
