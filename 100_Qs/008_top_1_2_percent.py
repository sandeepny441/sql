# Top Percentage (Adjusted for Small Dataset):

# Who is the top-ranked employee if we consider the top 20% in terms of EmployeeID order?
# Top Percentage (Hypothetical for Larger Dataset):

# Can you list the employees who fall into the top 2% in terms of performance scores? (Assuming there is a performance score column)
# Who are the employees in the top 4% in terms of seniority? (Assuming there is a column indicating the length of service)
